 # RoboCup Junior Maze Entry

## Rescue Maze Entry rules
The mission is, to find all the red 'victims', so that they can be saved. If the half of the robot goes over the black field, then it get put back to a checkpoint. Checkpoints are a silver field which don't need any proof of interaction and is the place your robot goes to when it either gets stuck or goes too much on a black field. There aren't a lot of obstacles, but most of them are hard to beat. Like turning. It souds super easy, but in reality, it's one of the hardest parts of maze. If you want to get as much points as possible, you need to make it turn exactly where you need it to, but that isn't really easy, no matter which code language you use.

## The robot
The robot is made out of lego, so you can either use the NXT or the EV3 to build your robot. So it's your choice (mostly) for which robot to use. I had to use the NXT, even though it has some bugs, it is a good robot. But I will still advise you to use the EV3, it's just so much better.

# My programm
Of course, I didn't just use any code language. I used NXC, which is C, but for the NXT. It was made by the team RoCCI, which I am in now, and I used it for the tournament. 

## How I made my programm
I made mine with two ultrasonic sensors and a light sensor. If the front Wallsensor sees the wall from a certain amount, then it should turn to the left. If the front and left Wallsensor sees the wall, then turn right. If sees Red, then stop for 5 seconds. If see Black, go backwards, then turn. Else just go forward. Probally not the best programm, but it worked and that is all that matters. My brother was mad about the last round, but that just ruined everyones mood. I think it was fine, even though we were in the eight place.

## My team
My team name is Vins.
