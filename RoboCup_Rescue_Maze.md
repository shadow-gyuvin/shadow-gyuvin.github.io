 # RoboCup Junior Maze Entry

## Rescue Maze Entry rules
The mission is, to find all the red 'victims', so that they can be saved. If the half of the robot goes over the black field, then it get put back to a checkpoint. Checkpoints are a silver field which don't need any proof of interaction and is the place your robot goes to when it either gets stuck or goes too much on a black field. There aren't a lot of obstacles, but most of them are hard to beat. Like turning. It souds super easy, but in reality, it's one of the hardest parts of maze. If you want to get as much points as possible, you need to make it turn exactly where you need it to, but that isn't really easy, no matter which code language you use.

# My programm
I used a special version of C+++ known as Arduino. It can be used to program a robot or any other mechanical constructs.

## How I made my programm
I made mine with a ultrasonic and a light sensor. If the front ultrasonic sensor sees the wall from a certain amount, then it should turn to the right. If it sees a wall again, then turn right twice. If sees Red, then stop for 5 seconds. If see Black, go backwards, then turn. Else just go forward. Probally not the best programm, but it worked and that is all that matters.
